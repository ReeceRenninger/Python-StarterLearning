##!! while loops

    spam = spam + 1

# same as for loop below using while loop
print('My name is')
i = 0
while i < 5:

##!! for loops

print('My name is')
for i in range(5):
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')

##!! range() function allows you to execute a for loop a certain number of times without the need to use a counter
##!! range(1, 12) is the start and end values, range(0, 10, 2) is the start, end, and step values is how much the loop increases or decreases with each iteration
total = 0
for num in range(101): # up to but not including 101
    total = total + num
print(total) # 5050
